# 1 Introduction


## 1.1 Why iCare?

Many of us spend plenty of time staring at the computer screen every day. This can put a lot of strain on our eyes and cause eye fatigue. iCare is a desktop app that uses the 20-20-20 rule to motivate users to develop good habits to avoid eye strain without being too intrusive to their schedule. iCare would suggest users to take a 20-second break every 20 minutes and look at something at least 20 feet away.
