# 1 Introduction

## 1.1 Why iCare?

Many of us spend plenty of time staring at the computer screen every day. This can put a lot of strain on our eyes and cause eye fatigue. iCare is a desktop app that uses the 20-20-20 rule to motivate users to develop good habits to avoid eye strain without being too intrusive to their schedule. iCare would suggest users to take a 20-second break every 20 minutes and look at something at least 20 feet away.

## 1.2 The 20-20-20 rule

The 20-20-20 rule is the idea that, every 20 minutes spent using a screen, you should try to look away from the device and look at something that is 20 feet away for a total of 20 seconds. This is done in order to take care of your eyes in the current digital age where many people spend their day staring at their screens.

While the rule recommends that you look at something that is 20 feet away, being exact isn’t the idea. You should just try to focus on something that is far away from you for 20 seconds, which is the amount of time it takes for your eyes to completely relax.
